# LaundryManagementSystem
The Laundry Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and automate laundry services. I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for frontend, Flask(python) for backend, MongoDB a NoSQL Database.

# Background:
Laundry facilities are essential services at NIT-T Campus. Managing laundry operations efficiently and providing customers with timely status updates on their laundry orders is a challenge for laundry service providers. To address this, I aim to develop a Laundry Management System (LMS) that streamlines laundry operations, enhances customer experience, and ensures a smooth and efficient laundry processing workflow.

# Problem Description:
The Laundry Management System seeks to address the following key problems:
1. Inefficient Laundry Operations: Many laundry facilities still rely on manual processes, leading to inefficiencies in laundry order management, machine scheduling, and resource allocation.
2. Lack of Transparency: Customers often lack real-time information about the status of their laundry orders, leading to frustration and inconvenience.
3. Order Tracking Challenges: Tracking the status of laundry orders, from drop-off to pick-up, can be challenging for both customers and service providers.

# Solution Objectives:
The Laundry Management System aims to achieve the following objectives:
1. Efficient Operations: Automate laundry order management, machine scheduling, and resource allocation to optimize laundry processing.
2. Customer Transparency: Provide customers with real-time updates on the status of their laundry orders through a user-friendly interface.
3. Order Tracking: Enable easy tracking of laundry orders at every stage, from order placement to delivery or pick-up.
